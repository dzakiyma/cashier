## Project Description
This project aims to make a cashier self-service program. Some of the initial features requested are:
* Create an ID transaction
* Add item (item name, item amount, item price)
* Update item
* Delete Item
* Reset the transaction
* Check the order list
* Calculate the total price
* and Discount features

But while making the program, I decided to develop it using a database that stores data on product names and prices. So that the customer only needs to add the item name and the number of items, then the price will be automatically added. Because of that, I choose a cafe or restaurant to be used as an example for this program because there are fewer menus and prices that have to be made in the database rather than supermarkets.

I built the program based on the customer journey. From that, I develop some features to accommodate the customer journey when want to order something.
In short, this is the customer journey flow:

## How it works
* Download all files into one local directory.
* Open initiate.py and run it.
* The program will be starting and you just have to follow the instructions of the program.
* In the program, have some features to control your input so that the Error will never be happen and the program can finish perfectly.
